# SPAM/HAM Message Classification using NLP

This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** for classifying SMS messages as **SPAM** or **HAM** (non-spam). The project uses a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict whether a given SMS message is spam or not, based on a trained model and TF-IDF features.
